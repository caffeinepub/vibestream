  "summary": "Both REQ-16 and REQ-17 appear to be implemented in the diff. App.tsx now handles all three profile-resolution cases (existing profile, no profile showing ProfileSetupModal, error showing retry button) and gates the loading screen with (actorFetching || profileLoading) && !isFetched. useQueries.ts sets enabled: !!actor && !actorFetching && !!identity to prevent firing with a null or anonymous actor. All core acceptance criteria appear covered with no significant missing requirements or hallucinated features.",
