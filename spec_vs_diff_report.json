  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of REQ-15, including a redesigned LoginScreen with animated branding, feature carousel, loading state on the Sign In button, a multi-step ProfileSetupModal with step indicator, dark theme styling, and inline profile setup flow. The implementation covers most acceptance criteria well.",

      "requirement": "No changes are made to useInternetIdentity.ts, useActor.ts, or main.tsx.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show these files as modified, which is correct. However the diff is truncated and we cannot fully confirm main.tsx was untouched since it is listed as a constraint.",
