The app must never show any loading or splash state — unauthenticated users see the LoginScreen immediately, and authenticated users with a known profile go directly to the main layout. If a profile fetch is still in-flight after authentication, skip the loading screen and instead render the main layout or the ProfileSetupModal as soon as the state resolves, without any intermediate loading indicator.",
