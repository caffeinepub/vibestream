The profile loading state must resolve correctly in all cases: (1) when the user has an existing profile — proceed to the main app, (2) when the user has no profile — show the ProfileSetupModal, (3) when the backend query errors or returns null/empty — do not remain stuck; show an appropriate fallback or retry option. Ensure the React Query profile fetch (getMyProfile or equivalent) uses the authenticated actor, handles loading/error/success states exhaustively, and does not stall indefinitely due to a missing actor, unauthenticated call, or unhandled promise rejection.",

If the actor is not yet initialized (e.g., still null or anonymous), the query should be disabled (enabled: false) rather than executing and returning an empty/error result that causes the loading state to hang. Re-enable and refetch automatically once the authenticated actor is ready.",
