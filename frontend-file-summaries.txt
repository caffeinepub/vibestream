{
  "frontend/src/components/ExploreView.tsx": "Explore/Trending page with debounced search and trending grid. Fixed the `useDebounce` hook to use `useRef<ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null>` with a proper `useEffect` instead of the invalid inline cast that caused the TypeScript error.",
  "frontend/src/components/CommentsPanel.tsx": "Bottom-sheet comments panel for a post with comment list, add/delete functionality, and author avatars. Fixed all `flex-shrink-0` occurrences to the Tailwind v3 equivalent `shrink-0`.",
  "frontend/src/components/ProfileView.tsx": "User profile page showing avatar, stats, follow/unfollow, edit profile, and post grid. Fixed `flex-shrink-0` to `shrink-0` and removed the unused `Users` import to keep the file clean.",
  "frontend/src/components/BottomNav.tsx": "Fixed bottom navigation bar with four tabs (Home, Explore, Upload, Profile) using proper `LucideProps` type for icon components so `color` prop is accepted without TypeScript errors.",
  "frontend/src/components/EditProfileModal.tsx": "New modal component for editing user profile (username, bio, profile picture) with upload progress tracking, validation, and save/cancel actions. This file was missing from the initial build output (truncated) and is now fully implemented.",
  "frontend/src/pages/LoginScreen.tsx": "Redesigned login screen with animated VibeStream branding, auto-rotating feature carousel (videos, trending, likes, follows), stats row, and a prominent \"Get Started\" CTA button with loading state tied to Internet Identity's loginStatus.",
  "frontend/src/components/ProfileSetupModal.tsx": "Multi-step full-screen onboarding wizard (Step 1: username, Step 2: bio, Step 3: avatar) with step indicator, inline validation, skip options, upload progress tracking, and smooth fade-in animations — rendered as a full-screen view rather than a floating modal overlay.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main app component orchestrating the auth flow; shows LoginScreen immediately for unauthenticated users, ProfileSetupModal for authenticated users without a profile, and MainLayout for fully set-up users — with no loading screen or spinner at any point.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "All React Query hooks for backend interactions; the `useGetCallerUserProfile` hook is fixed to compute `isLoading` only when data hasn't been fetched yet (not gated on `actorFetching` once data exists), and `isFetched` is simplified to `!!identity && query.isFetched` to avoid false negatives from background actor refetches."
